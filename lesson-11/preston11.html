                <h4>The Origin of Pancakes in the Park</h4>
            <p>Pancakes in the park has been a tradition in Preston, Idaho since the town was founded in 1866. Pancakes were an easy meal that could feed a large
                number of people quickly before the began working on building up homes and other buildings when establishing the town. Since then, the town leaders
                began to invite all town members for pancakes in the park each Saturday after Preston was established. This was enacted to help promote bonding and 
                friendships among those who were living in Preston and anybody that settled there afterwards.
            </p>
            <p> 
                We are commonly asked what makes the pancakes that are served so fluffy, buttery and light. We are here to answer that question. The secret to the 
                pancakes is the freshly made buttermilk that is made using the milk provided by our local farmers right here in Preston. During the summer, there is 
                freshly picked fruit available to top the pancakes with. Then during the winter, there is hot apple cider made with apples picked in a nearby orchard
                to have with the pancakes that is sure to warm you up during the chilly winter days. Come visit us during pancakes in the park and make lifelong friendships
                while enjoying a hearty pancake breakfast.
